## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I speak JavaScript (but not Klingon) - Bonus points if you spotted the "Weird" Al Yankovic reference within the first seconds. (NO points if you had to Google it)

TypeScript too, but that's just a JS linter, I hear you cry! 

False, it is a superset of JavaScript, with all the extra type "safe" flavour that comes with it.

I am not sponsored by Microsoft though.

I'm currently working on finding a JOB.

I'm currently learning to cope with unemployment... and any other novel technologies I can get my hands on. 

There's plenty of tutorial hell on LinkedIn Learning to keep me occupied, and make me look good too!

Check out my awesome LinkedIn while you're at it. The link to the link is in the profile, for those curious enough to find it - I dare you to stalk it.

I'm looking to collaborate on any software projects that are reasonably ethical and interesting. (I'll wait)

Other languages I am comfortable with:
- English (wow, you guessed that, didn't you!)
- Python - Not the Monty variety. Even though that's where the name comes from.
- Java. I hear it's more than old enough to drink in America now.
- Go (and learn some programming)
- PHP (if you're into that cursed hypertext preprocessor, you probably need help, too.)
- HTML is a Markup Language, the clue is in the name.
- Cascading Style Sheets. If this is in your languages section too then you probably have marketed yourself as ineffectively as I needed to.
- SASS and LESS don't count either.
- The sequel to SQL is to squeal internally.

Favourite Frameworks:
ones that actually do.

Pronouns:
I'm more proverbs really.

Fun Fact:
I like games every sometimes.

How to reach me:
1. extend your arms
2. wish you hadn't

Waxing Philosophy is a great hobby of mine.

It is usually internal though.

Normally I have a low online footprint, but I don't care anymore.


<!- I Thought I'd include this comment section I didn't ask for to help get you started.
**Thomas-Griffin/Thomas-Griffin** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

--> DID YOU read all THAT?

GitHub AI agents probably did before you could.
